# Hospital Monitoring System (PIM IV)

This project outlines the development of a **Hospital Monitoring System** designed to register and track COVID-19 patients. The system, implemented in **C** with the **GTK** library for a graphical interface, supports hospital staff in managing patient data effectively.

## Features

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphical Interface**: GTK library
- **IDE**: Code::Blocks for development

### Functionality
- **Authentication**: Login screen for secure access with default credentials (`admin`/`admin`).
- **Main Dashboard**: Displays patient data and includes navigation options.
- **Add Patient**: Form to input patient details, calculate age, and classify them as high-risk if necessary.
- **Patient Tables**: Separate displays for regular patients and high-risk patients.
- **Data Storage**: Patient data saved in text files for hospital reporting and integration.

### Structure
- **Login and Main Screens**: Ensure secure access and centralize application navigation.
- **Dynamic Tables**: Show registered patients with real-time updates upon adding or editing records.
- **Risk Classification**: Automatically sorts patients over 65 or with comorbidities into a high-risk group.

## Screenshots
- **Login Screen**: Initial authentication interface.
